Predicting the Rating of a Movie based off the Director, Cast, &amp; Genre

Many sites allow users to rate the movies and TV shows they watch. What, however, determines the rating they give? Several factors go into making a movie, chief amongst them the script, the cast, the genre, and the director. Our project aims to create a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on an appropriate weighing of these features.
	Using the features from a merged dataset combining data from several different streaming platforms, we’ll train Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and other machine learning algorithms to predict movie ratings. Once we determine the most accurate model, we’ll then create another model predicting movie ratings based on platform and genre/ cast/ director as inputted by the user, and use those predictions to recommend a streaming platform for the user to buy.
